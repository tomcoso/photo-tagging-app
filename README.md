This project is a web SPA that uses react-router.

The concept of the game is to find the targets given that are hidden in the [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) final canvas of 2022, this canvas is a 10,000px square, and was built by the reddit community, where each user could place a single pixel every 5 minutes.

This results in a very chaotic expression of popular internet culture, and it is a snapshot of history.
